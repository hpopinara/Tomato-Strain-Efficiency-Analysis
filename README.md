# Tomato Water Efficiency Dataset

A small dataset comparing water consumption to fruit yield across 5 tomato varieties.

## Columns
- `Plant_ID`: Unique ID for each plant.
- `Variety`: Tomato type (Heirloom, Pink Brandy, Beefsteak, Plum, Black Heirloom).
- `Water_Consumed_Liters`: Total water used (L).
- `Tomatoes_Produced`: Total number of fruits.
- `Efficiency_Score`: Calculated as `Tomatoes_Produced / Water_Consumed_Liters`.
- `Efficiency_Rank`: Rank from 1 (least efficient) to 5 (most efficient).

## Quick Look
The Pink Brandy variety was the most water-efficient.
